# CPP-RPG-GAME-CONSOLE
Just a simple RPG game made from CPP(C++) that I'm actively updating.

Anyone may use this and edit it to their liking, but please do not just take all the code and say it is yours. If you use it for your own projects, credits would be appreciated but not required since this is very simple.
For a full commented out version for people new to CPP(C++) check version tag commented and look for the latest version.

If there are any issues, please send them in the issues tab so I can fix them quickly.

Thank you to everyone that uses and credits me for this, it is highly appreciated :)
